levelUpCascading
================

Cascading is a proven application development platform for building Data applications on Apache Hadoop.

Beginning with Cascading is really tough. The official guide for cascading is good, but for beginner guide might not work.
So, I've created this program to learn cascading from basics. Follow the levels and I am sure,  you will be good at cascading.

Don't just rely on this tutorial, you need to practise it hard and at the top of that, you need to read a guide. 

Also, I have included the documents for cascading in document folder. It will guide you throughout this program. 

Best of luck.
